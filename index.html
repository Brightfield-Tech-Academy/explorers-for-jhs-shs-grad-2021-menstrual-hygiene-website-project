                <p class="text-start text-white" style="font-size: 20px;">
                    Menstruation is the monthly flow of blood from the uterus through the vagina. It means a girl is growing up and her body is preparing for the future when she might get pregnant and have babies. It is commonly referred to as Period, a natural bodily function,
                    necessary for the reproductive health of women and adolescent girls. Menstruation occurs monthly for three to seven days, varying from female to female. The average amount of blood lost during a menstrual period is 30 to 72 millilitres
                    (5 to 12 teaspoons).

                                        The term menstruation refers to the periodic shedding of the uterine lining. (Menstru means "monthly.'') The average menstrual cycle takes about 28 days and occurs in phases: the follicular phase, the ovulatory
                                        phase (ovulation), and the luteal phase. There are four major hormones (chemicals that stimulate or regulate the activity of cells or organs) involved in the menstrual cycle: follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing
                                        hormone, estrogen, and progesterone

                                        <br>Use a sanitary napkin, tampon, or menstrual cup. All these methods are good, and you don’t need to switch. Stick with whatever you prefer. Change your sanitary napkin/tampon/menstrual cup frequently, even when
                                        the bleeding isn’t much. Menstrual blood tends to get contaminated with the body’s native organisms, so change regularly. This also helps you to avoid skin rashes. Regularly wash ..

                                    <li> Water <br> Drinking a lot of water is always important, and this is especially true during your period. Staying hydrated can reduce your chances of getting dehydration headaches, a common symptom of menstruation. Drinking
                                        plenty of water can also stop you from retaining water and bloating.

                                    <li>Fruit <br> Water-rich fruits, such as watermelon and cucumber, are great for staying hydrated. Sweet fruits can help you curb your sugar cravings without eating a lot of refined sugars, which can cause your glucose
                                        levels to spike and then crash.

                                    <li>Leafy green vegetables <br> It’s common to experience a dip in your iron levels during your period, particularly if your menstrual flow is heavy. This can lead to fatigue, bodily pain, and dizziness. Leafy green vegetables
                                        such as kale and spinach can boost your iron levels. Spinach is also rich in magnesium.

                                    <li>Fish <br> Rich in iron, protein, and omega-3 fatty acids, fish is a nutritious addition to your diet. Consuming iron will counteract the dip in iron levels that you might experience while menstruating. Omega-3s can
                                        reduce the intensity of period pain, according to a 2012 study. Subjects who took omega-3 supplements found that their menstrual pain decreased so much that they could reduce the amount of ibuprofen they took. A
                                        2014 study showed that omega-3s can also reduce depression. For those who experience mood swings and depression around menstruation, omega-3s may be helpful.

                                    <li> Turmeric <br> Turmeric is known as an anti-inflammatory spice, and curcumin is its main active ingredient. A 2015 study looked at the effects of curcumin on PMS symptoms and found that people who took curcumin had less
                                        severe symptoms.

                                    <li> Nuts <br> Most nuts are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, and they’re a great source of protein. They also contain magnesium and various vitamins. If you don’t want to eat nuts on their own, try nut butters or nut-based
                                        milks or add these ingredients to smoothies.

                                    <li> Yogurt <br> Many people get yeast infections during or after their period. If you tend to get yeast infections, probiotic-rich foods like yogurt can nourish the “good” bacteria in your vagina and may help you fight
                                        the infections. Yogurt is also rich in magnesium and other essential nutrients, like calcium.

                                <h1 class="mt-5 text-center">WHY MENSTRUAL HYGIENE MATTERS</h1>
                                <p class="container text-center" style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 1cm; padding: 30px;">Globally, approximately 52% of the female population (26% of the total population) is of reproductive age. Most of these women and girls will menstruate each month for between two and seven days. To manage menstruation
                                    hygienically and with dignity, it is essential that women and girls have access to water and sanitation. They need somewhere private to change sanitary cloths or pads; clean water and soap for washing their hands, bodies
                                    and reusable cloths; and facilities for safely disposing of used materials or a clean place to dry them if reusable. There is also a need for both men and women to have a greater awareness of good menstrual hygiene
                                    practices.
                                </p>
                                <p class="container text-center pb-5" style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 1cm; padding-top: 10px;">Menstruation is a natural process, but in most parts of the world it is taboo and rarely talked about. It has also been largely neglected by the WASH sector and other sectors focusing on sexual and reproductive health,
                                    and education. As a result, the practical challenges of menstrual hygiene are made even more difficult by socio-cultural factors and millions of women and girls continue to be denied their rights to WASH, health, education,
                                    dignity and gender equity.

                                <h1 class="text-center ">IMPACT ON EDUCATION</h1>
                                <p class="container text-center" style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 1cm; padding: 20px;">
                                    Impact on education Many schools do not support adolescent girls or female teachers in managing menstrual hygiene with dignity. Inadequate water and sanitation facilities, make managing menstruation very difficult, and poor sanitary protection materials
                                    can result in blood-stained clothes causing stress and embarrassment. Teachers (and male members of staff in particular) can be unaware of girls' needs, in some cases refusing to let them visit the latrine. As a result,
                                    girls have been reported to miss school during their menstrual periods or even drop out completely. </p>
