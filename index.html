        <p class="text-start text-dark" style="font-size: 20px;">
            Menstruation is the monthly flow of blood from the uterus through the vagina. It means a girl is growing up and her body is preparing for the future when she might get pregnant and have babies. It is commonly referred to as Period, a natural bodily function,
            necessary for the reproductive health of women and adolescent girls. Menstruation occurs monthly for three to seven days, varying from female to female. The average amount of blood lost during a menstrual period is 30 to 72 millilitres (5
            to 12 teaspoons).

        <p style="font-size: 25px; padding-top: 60px;" class="text-start">
            All girls go through a pre-menarche stage. This is the time before menstruation begins. Typically girls start to menstruate during puberty or adolescence, usually between the ages of<b style="color: hotpink;"> 10 and 19</b>. A delay in the
            onset of menstruation is normal. Most girls will have regular menstruation from age <b style="color: hotpink;"> 16 to 18</b>. A woman can expect to see her menstrual period continuously until she reaches her menopause. This usually begins
            when she approaches her late 40s and 50s.</p>
        <h2 class="text-center" style="color: chartreuse;">HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW YOUR CYCLE?</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 25px; padding-top: 35px; line-height: 1cm;" class="text-center">The time from the first day of a girl’s menstruation (when bleeding starts) to the first day of her next menstruation is usually 28 days (one month), but this can range from 21-35 days. this interval is known as menstrual cycle. It is important
            to keep track of your cycle to prepare for your menstruation and avoid uncomfortable situations
        </p>
        <img src="./images/cycle.jpg" alt="image of reproductive cycle" style="width: 10cm; height: 7cm;">
        <p style="font-size: 25px; padding-top: 50px; line-height: 1cm;">It is normal and natural to experience mood changes during your menstrual cycle; the changing levels of hormones during a girl’s cycle can affect her moods. This is known as PMS short for Pre- Menstrual Syndrome. Not all girls get this, but some
            do a few days before they start their menstruation, You can manage your mood changes by educating those close to you on your situation so they know how to relate to you during this time. Laughing, exercising, deep breathing and stretching
            are all ways to relax so that your moods are better managed

        <h3 class="text-center  pt-5" style="color: chartreuse;">WHAT HAPPENS DURING MENSTRUAL CYCLE? </h3>
        <p style="font-size: 25px; padding-top: 15px;" class="text-center"> Females of reproductive age experience cycles of hormonal activity that repeat at about one-month intervals. With every cycle, a woman's body prepares for a potential pregnancy, whether or not that is the woman's intention. The term menstruation
            refers to the periodic shedding of the uterine lining. (Menstru means "monthly.'') The average menstrual cycle takes about 28 days and occurs in phases: the follicular phase, the ovulatory phase (ovulation), and the luteal phase. There are
            four major hormones (chemicals that stimulate or regulate the activity of cells or organs) involved in the menstrual cycle: follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estrogen, and progesterone

            <li> Water <br> Drinking a lot of water is always important, and this is especially true during your period. Staying hydrated can reduce your chances of getting dehydration headaches, a common symptom of menstruation. Drinking plenty of water can

            <li>Leafy green vegetables <br> It’s common to experience a dip in your iron levels during your period, particularly if your menstrual flow is heavy. This can lead to fatigue, bodily pain, and dizziness. Leafy green vegetables such as kale and
                spinach can boost your iron levels. Spinach is also rich in magnesium.

            <li> Chicken <br> Chicken is another iron- and protein-rich food you can add to your diet. Eating protein is essential for your overall health, and it can help you stay full and sated during your period, curbing cravings.

            <li>Fish <br> Rich in iron, protein, and omega-3 fatty acids, fish is a nutritious addition to your diet. Consuming iron will counteract the dip in iron levels that you might experience while menstruating. Omega-3s can reduce the intensity of
                period pain, according to a 2012 study. Subjects who took omega-3 supplements found that their menstrual pain decreased so much that they could reduce the amount of ibuprofen they took. A 2014 study showed that omega-3s can also reduce
                depression. For those who experience mood swings and depression around menstruation, omega-3s may be helpful.

            <li> Turmeric <br> Turmeric is known as an anti-inflammatory spice, and curcumin is its main active ingredient. A 2015 study looked at the effects of curcumin on PMS symptoms and found that people who took curcumin had less severe symptoms.</li>

            <li> Nuts <br> Most nuts are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, and they’re a great source of protein. They also contain magnesium and various vitamins. If you don’t want to eat nuts on their own, try nut butters or nut-based milks or add these ingredients
                to smoothies.

            <li> Yogurt <br> Many people get yeast infections during or after their period. If you tend to get yeast infections, probiotic-rich foods like yogurt can nourish the “good” bacteria in your vagina and may help you fight the infections.</li>

            Yogurt is also rich in magnesium and other essential nutrients, like calcium.

            <h3 class="mt-5 text-center">WHY MENSTRUAL HYGIENE MATTERS</h3>
            <p class="container text-center" style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 1cm; padding: 30px;">Globally, approximately 52% of the female population (26% of the total population) is of reproductive age. Most of these women and girls will menstruate each month for between two and seven days. To manage menstruation hygienically and with
                dignity, it is essential that women and girls have access to water and sanitation. They need somewhere private to change sanitary cloths or pads; clean water and soap for washing their hands, bodies and reusable cloths; and facilities
                for safely disposing of used materials or a clean place to dry them if reusable. There is also a need for both men and women to have a greater awareness of good menstrual hygiene practices.</p>
            <p class="container text-center pb-5" style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 1cm; padding-top: 10px;">Menstruation is a natural process, but in most parts of the world it is taboo and rarely talked about. It has also been largely neglected by the WASH sector and other sectors focusing on sexual and reproductive health, and education. As a
                result, the practical challenges of menstrual hygiene are made even more difficult by socio-cultural factors and millions of women and girls continue to be denied their rights to WASH, health, education, dignity and gender equity.

            <h1 class="text-center">IMPACT ON EDUCATION</h1>
            <p class="container text-center" style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 1cm; padding: 20px;">
                Impact on education Many schools do not support adolescent girls or female teachers in managing menstrual hygiene with dignity. Inadequate water and sanitation facilities, make managing menstruation very difficult, and poor sanitary protection materials
                can result in blood-stained clothes causing stress and embarrassment. Teachers (and male members of staff in particular) can be unaware of girls' needs, in some cases refusing to let them visit the latrine. As a result, girls have been
                reported to miss school during their menstrual periods or even drop out completely.</p>
