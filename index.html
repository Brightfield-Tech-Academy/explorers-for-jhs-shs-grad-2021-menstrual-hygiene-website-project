         <p class="text-start text-dark" style="font-size: 20px;">
             Menstruation is the monthly flow of blood from the uterus through the vagina.
            It means a girl is growing up and her body is preparing for the future when she
            might get pregnant and have babies. It is commonly referred to as Period, a
            natural bodily function, necessary for the reproductive health of women and
            adolescent girls. Menstruation occurs monthly for three to seven days, varying
            from female to female. The average amount of blood lost during a menstrual
            period is 30 to 72 millilitres (5 to 12 teaspoons). </p>

            All girls go through a pre-menarche stage. This is the time before menstruation
            begins. Typically girls start to menstruate during puberty or adolescence, usually

            Most girls will have regular menstruation from age <b style="color: hotpink;"> 16 to 18</b>.
            A woman can expect to see her menstrual period continuously until she reaches

         <p style="font-size: 20px; padding-top: 60px;" class="text-start">Your menstrual cycle is the interval between your first and your next menstrual
            period. On average, the length of the menstrual cycle is 28 days, but generally
            this varies from woman to woman. Regular cycles that are longer or shorter
            than this, from 21-35 days, are normal.</p>

               <p style="font-size: 20px; padding-top: 15px;" class="text-start"> Females of reproductive age experience cycles of hormonal activity that repeat at about one-month intervals. With every cycle, a woman's body prepares for a potential pregnancy, whether or not that is the woman's intention. The term menstruation refers to the periodic shedding of the uterine lining. (Menstru means "monthly.'')
                
                The average menstrual cycle takes about 28 days and occurs in phases: the follicular phase, the ovulatory phase (ovulation), and the luteal phase.
                
                There are four major hormones (chemicals that stimulate or regulate the activity of cells or organs) involved in the menstrual cycle: follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estrogen, and progesterone</p>

                the changing levels of hormones during a girl’s cycle can affect her moods. This is
                known as PMS short for Pre- Menstrual Syndrome. Not all girls get this, but some
                do a few days before they start their menstruation, You can manage your mood
                changes by educating those close to you on your situation so they know how to
                relate to you during this time. Laughing, exercising, deep breathing and stretching

        </li> <br>
            
            <li> Fruit <br>
            Water-rich fruits, such as watermelon and cucumber, are great for staying hydrated. Sweet fruits can help you curb your sugar cravings without eating a lot of refined sugars, which can cause your glucose levels to spike and then crash.</li>

            <li> Leafy green vegetables <br>
            It’s common to experience a dip in your iron levels during your period, particularly if your menstrual flow is heavy. This can lead to fatigue, bodily pain, and dizziness.
            
            Leafy green vegetables such as kale and spinach can boost your iron levels. Spinach is also rich in magnesium.</li>
             <div><img src="./images/vegetable.jpg" class="w-100" alt=""></div> <br>
            <li> Ginger <br>
            A warm mug of ginger tea can improve certain symptoms of menstruation. Ginger has anti-inflammatory effects, which can soothe achy muscles.
            
            Ginger may also reduce nausea. Few studies confirm this, but a 2018 study found that ginger effectively reduced nausea and vomiting during the first trimester of pregnancy. Since it’s safe and relatively cheap, it’s worth trying.
            
            Don’t consume too much ginger, though: Consuming more than 4 grams in one day could cause heartburn and stomachaches.</li>
            <div><img src="" alt=""></div>
            <li> Chicken <br>
            Chicken is another iron- and protein-rich food you can add to your diet. Eating protein is essential for your overall health, and it can help you stay full and sated during your period, curbing cravings.</li>
             <div><img src="./images/chicken.jpg" class="w-100" alt=""></div>
            <li>. Fish <br>
            Rich in iron, protein, and omega-3 fatty acids, fish is a nutritious addition to your diet. Consuming iron will counteract the dip in iron levels that you might experience while menstruating.
            
            Omega-3s can reduce the intensity of period pain, according to a 2012 study. Subjects who took omega-3 supplements found that their menstrual pain decreased so much that they could reduce the amount of ibuprofen they took.
            
            A 2014 study showed that omega-3s can also reduce depression. For those who experience mood swings and depression around menstruation, omega-3s may be helpful.</li>

            <li> Turmeric <br>
            Turmeric is known as an anti-inflammatory spice, and curcumin is its main active ingredient. A 2015 study looked at the effects of curcumin on PMS symptoms and found that people who took curcumin had less severe symptoms.</li>

            <li> Nuts <br>
            Most nuts are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, and they’re a great source of protein. They also contain magnesium and various vitamins. If you don’t want to eat nuts on their own, try nut butters or nut-based milks or add these ingredients to smoothies.</li>
            <div><img src="./images/nuts.webp" class="w-100" alt=""></div> <br>
          
            <li> Yogurt <br>
            Many people get yeast infections during or after their period. If you tend to get yeast infections, probiotic-rich foods like yogurt can nourish the “good” bacteria in your vagina and may help you fight the infections.</li>
            
            Yogurt is also rich in magnesium and other essential nutrients, like calcium.</li>

    <h4 class="mt-5">Why Menstrual hygiene matters</h4>
    <p class="container text-center" style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1cm; padding: 50px;">Globally, approximately 52% of the female population (26% of the total population) is of reproductive age. Most of these women and girls will menstruate each month for between two and seven days.

        To manage menstruation hygienically and with dignity, it is essential that women and girls have access to water and sanitation. They need somewhere private to change sanitary cloths or pads; clean water and soap for washing their hands, bodies and reusable cloths; and facilities for safely disposing of used materials or a clean place to dry them if reusable. There is also a need for both men and women to have a greater awareness of good menstrual hygiene practices.</p>
    <p class="container text-center" style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1cm; padding-top: 10px;">Menstruation is a natural process, but in most parts of the world it is taboo and rarely talked about. It has also been largely neglected by the WASH sector and other sectors focusing on sexual and reproductive health, and education.

        As a result, the practical challenges of menstrual hygiene are made even more difficult by socio-cultural factors and millions of women and girls continue to be denied their rights to WASH, health, education, dignity and gender equity.

     <h4 class="text-center p-5">IMPACT ON EDUCATION</h1>
     <p  class="container text-center" style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 1cm; padding: 50px;">
        Impact on education
        
        Many schools do not support adolescent girls or female teachers in managing menstrual hygiene with dignity. Inadequate water and sanitation facilities, make managing menstruation very difficult, and poor sanitary protection materials can result in blood-stained clothes causing stress and embarrassment.
        
        Teachers (and male members of staff in particular) can be unaware of girls' needs, in some cases refusing to let them visit the latrine. As a result, girls have been reported to miss school during their menstrual periods or even drop out completely.</p>
